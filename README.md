Pebble Intervals v2.0
=================

This app allows the user to set up to five interval timers. For each interval the user will set a time. In run mode, the timer counts down the time set for the interval. Once the time for the interval elapses, the watch will vibrate a number of times to signify which interval just elapsed. The next interval will be started automatically. Once all of the intervals have elapsed, the app will start back over with the first and continue until the timer is paused or the app is exited.

Version 2.0
The app is no longer full screen and will display the current time in the status bar.

## Operation
**Set Mode: Interval Count**

The first screen let's you choose how many intervals to have. Use the up and down buttons to change the number of intervals. 

*Note:* In this version you can have up to ten intervals. However, this is an arbitrary value and you should be able to bump it up to 18 before you overflow the total elapsed time counter. This should be a simple change.

Double press the select (middle) button to progress to the time set screens.

**Set Mode: Time Set**

For each interval you can set a time between 1 second and 59 minutes and 59 seconds. 

The flashing unit signifies the unit to be set.

Single press or press and hold the up and down button to change the value of the unit.

To switch units, press the select button. 

To go to the next time set screen or to go to run mode double press the select button.

To return to any previous step, long press the select button.

**Run Mode**

Single press the select button to start and stop the timer. 

You can skip to the next or previous intervals by pressing the up and down buttons respectively. 

While paused, you can go to previous screens simply long press the select button. This will clear all timers when you go back to run mode.
